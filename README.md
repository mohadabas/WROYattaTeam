In this repository we have stored all diagrams and codes related to our robot building process
Our team, as part of its participation in the competition in the field of future engineers, designed a robot capable of rotating around the competition circuit as was required in the terms and laws of the competition. To implement this project, we used a number of electronic parts, including Ultrasonic sensors , Gyroscope , Color sensors, servo motors ,Raspberry Pi 3 , Arduino Mega ,Dc motor and motor H-bridge.
